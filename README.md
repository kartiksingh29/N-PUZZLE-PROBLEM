# N-PUZZLE-PROBLEM

Here in the source code , we will be taking the input n ( as size of the n*n  matrix ) .
After that we generate an start state n*n matrix and a goal state n*n matrix .

We will be computing the heuristic value dynamically as the number of differing cells in the current state and goal state.
Our objective will be to try to minimise this value as much as possible using the following three algorithms :

1) Simple Hill Climbing .

2) Simple HIll Climbing with Random Restarts .

3) Hill Climbing with Simulated Annealing .

We are applying these three algorithms ,in the order specified above , and we are displaying the maximum optimised heuristic value and matrix .
We will also be telling whether optimal state is achieved or not in each of these algorithms .
